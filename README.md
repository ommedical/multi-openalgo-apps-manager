# Multi‑App Manager for `uv run app.py`

A cross‑platform process manager that starts, stops, and monitors multiple Openalgo Python applications, each located in a separate subdirectory and launched with `uv run app.py`. All output is automatically saved to per‑app log files, and you can view logs on‑demand.

---

## Features

- **Start / Stop / Restart** individual apps or all apps at once
- **Status** – quickly see which apps are running and their PIDs
- **List** – show all discovered apps and their paths
- **Logs** – tail the log file of a single app or all apps simultaneously
- **Cross‑platform** – works on Windows (using `tasklist` and `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`) and Unix‑like systems (using process groups and `SIGTERM`)
- **Clean state** – PID files are automatically cleaned when a process is no longer running
- **Configurable base directory** – look for app folders in any location via `--base`
- **Verbose mode** – get extra details during start/stop operations

---

## How It Works

The manager scans a **base directory** (default: current working directory) for subfolders that contain an `app.py` file. Each such subfolder is considered an app. When you start an app, the manager:

1. Checks if it’s already running (via PID file and process list).
2. Launches `uv run app.py` in the app’s folder, redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to a dedicated log file (located in `.app_data/logs/`).
3. Stores the process ID in a PID file (`.app_data/pids/`).

When stopping an app, the manager:
- Sends a graceful termination signal (`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` on Windows, `SIGTERM` to the whole process group on Unix).
- Waits up to 5 seconds for the process to exit.
- If it’s still alive, forces termination (`taskkill /F` on Windows, `SIGKILL` on Unix).
- Removes the PID file.

The log tailing functionality (`logs`) shows existing content first and then follows new lines (like `tail -f`). The `logs all` command polls all log files every 0.1 seconds and prints new lines with a `[appname]` prefix.

---

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** and **uv** installed (`pip install uv`).
2. Place `manage_apps.py` in the directory **above** your app folders, or set the `OPENALGO_BASE` environment variable to point to the folder containing your apps.
3. Ensure each app subfolder contains an `app.py` file that can be run with `uv run app.py`.

No other dependencies are required – everything uses the Python standard library.

## Usage

All commands are executed with:

```bash
uv run manage_apps.py <command> [options]
```

### Commands

| Command                 | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start <app\|all>`      | Start one app or all apps. If an app is already running, it prints a message and does nothing.  |
| `stop <app\|all>`       | Stop one app or all apps gracefully (force‑kill after 5 seconds).                               |
| `restart <app\|all>`    | Stop and then start the specified app(s).                                                       |
| `status`                | Show the running status and PID (if any) for all discovered apps.                               |
| `list`                  | List all discovered apps and their full paths.                                                  |
| `logs <app\|all>`       | Tail the log file of a specific app or all apps. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.                        |
| `git-pull <app\|all>`   | Update the code of the specified app(s). (Only works for manage_apps_advance.py file code)      |

### Options

| Option               | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--base DIR`, `-b DIR` | Base directory where app folders are located (default: current working directory).            |
| `--verbose`, `-v`    | Show detailed information (e.g., PID when starting, force‑kill message when stopping).        |

---

## Examples

### 1. Basic usage

```bash
# List all discovered apps
uv run manage_apps.py list

# Start any single apps
uv run manage_apps.py start myapp

OR

# Start all apps
uv run manage_apps.py start all

# Check status
uv run manage_apps.py status

# Stop a single app
uv run manage_apps.py stop myapp

OR

# Stop all apps
uv run manage_apps.py stop all

# Restart a single app
uv run manage_apps.py restart myapp

OR

# Restart all apps
uv run manage_apps.py restart all
```

### 2. Viewing logs

```bash
# Tail logs of a single app
uv run manage_apps.py logs myapp

# Tail logs of all apps (with prefixes)
uv run manage_apps.py logs all
```

### 3. Using a different base directory

If your apps are not in the current directory, point to them:

```bash
uv run manage_apps.py --base /path/to/apps start all
```

### 4. Verbose output

```bash
uv run manage_apps.py --verbose start myapp
```

This will print the PID and the log file path.

### 5. Suppressing output entirely (silent mode)

If you want to hide the manager’s own messages (e.g., in scripts), redirect stdout and stderr:

**Windows:**
```bash
uv run manage_apps.py start all > nul 2>&1
```

**Unix / Linux / macOS:**
```bash
uv run manage_apps.py start all > /dev/null 2>&1
```

*Note:* The apps’ logs are still written to their respective log files; only the manager’s console output is suppressed.

---

## File Structure

When you run the manager for the first time, it creates a hidden folder `.app_data` in the same directory as `manage_apps.py`:

```
.
├── manage_apps.py
├── .app_data/
│   ├── logs/
│   │   ├── myapp.log
│   │   └── otherapp.log
│   └── pids/
│       ├── myapp.pid
│       └── otherapp.pid
└── myapp/                 # your app folder
    └── app.py
```

- **Logs** – Contains all output (stdout + stderr) from each app.
- **PID files** – Store the process ID of the running app; they are automatically removed when the app stops.

---

## Environment Variables

You can override the base directory and state directory using environment variables (useful for scripting):

- `OPENALGO_BASE` – Base directory containing app folders.
- `OPENALGO_STATE` – Directory where logs and PID files are stored (default is `~/.openalgo_manager`). If you set this, the manager will use that location instead of the `.app_data` folder.

*Note:* If both the environment variable and the `--base` option are provided, the command‑line option takes precedence.

---

## Advanced Notes

### How the Manager Detects Running Processes

- **Unix:** Uses `os.kill(pid, 0)` to check if the process exists.
- **Windows:** Runs `tasklist /FI "PID eq <pid>"` and looks for the PID in the output.  
  *Potential limitation:* If the PID appears as part of another number (e.g., 1234 is a substring of 12345), it might be a false positive – but this is extremely unlikely because `tasklist` formats output in columns.

### Graceful Shutdown

- **Unix:** Sends `SIGTERM` to the whole **process group** (using `os.killpg`) so that child processes also receive the signal.
- **Windows:** Sends `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` – this only works for console applications that were started with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`. If the app is a GUI application, it will fall back to `taskkill /F` after 5 seconds.

### Log Encoding

Log files are opened with `encoding="utf-8"` and `errors="replace"`. Any invalid UTF‑8 bytes are replaced with the `�` character, ensuring the manager never crashes due to encoding issues.

### Tail‑All Implementation

The `logs all` command polls all log files every 0.1 seconds. This is simple, cross‑platform, and works well for a small number of apps. For very high‑frequency logging, you may notice a slight delay, but it remains functional.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                      | Solution                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `App 'myapp' not found.`                     | Make sure the app’s folder contains an `app.py` file and that you’re using the correct base directory. |
| `Failed to start myapp: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'uv'` | Ensure `uv` is installed and in your PATH. Run `uv --version` to verify.                             |
| Log files are empty or missing                | Check that the app actually produces output. If it does, verify that the log file location is writable. |
| `UnicodeDecodeError` when viewing logs       | The script now uses `errors="replace"` – upgrade to the latest version of the script.                |
| App won’t stop gracefully                     | Some apps may ignore termination signals. The manager will force‑kill after 5 seconds. You can adjust `GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT` in the script. |
| `logs all` shows “Log file not found (waiting...)” | The app hasn’t created its log file yet (maybe it’s not running). Once it starts, the message will disappear. |

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests for improvements. Some ideas:
- Add a configuration file to set per‑app timeouts.
- Implement log rotation to prevent large log files.
- Add a `--clean` command to remove old logs.
- Use `psutil` for more robust process checks (optional).

Happy managing!
